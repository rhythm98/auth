Keycloak Setup Guide
====================
These three Keycloak-related components serve different purposes in your authentication architecture:

1\. keycloak-js (Frontend Library)
----------------------------------

**Purpose**: Client-side authentication in your React application

*   Allows users to log in directly with Keycloak from the browser
*   Handles token management, session refresh, and logout
*   Provides methods for checking authentication status
*   Manages the OAuth/OIDC flows in the browser

**Use cases**:

*   Authenticating users via browser redirects
*   Storing and refreshing access tokens
*   Accessing user information from tokens
*   Handling logout

2\. keycloak-admin-client (Spring Boot Library)
-----------------------------------------------

**Purpose**: Server-side administrative operations for your Spring Boot backend

*   Programmatically manages users, roles, and groups
*   Creates, updates, and deletes resources in Keycloak
*   Performs operations that require privileged access
*   Handles advanced configuration not available to regular users

**Use cases**:

*   User registration (creating users in Keycloak)
*   Role/permission management
*   User profile updates requiring admin privileges
*   Custom flows that require server-side processing

3\. Keycloak Docker Image
-------------------------

**Purpose**: The actual identity server that provides authentication services

*   Stores user accounts and credentials
*   Issues and validates tokens
*   Defines authentication protocols and flows
*   Provides the admin UI for configuration

**Use cases**:

*   Central user management
*   Supporting OAuth/OIDC protocols
*   Token issuance and validation
*   Authentication and authorization server

Why Use Spring Boot When React Can Talk to Keycloak Directly?
-------------------------------------------------------------

While React can communicate directly with Keycloak for basic authentication, the Spring Boot backend serves several important purposes:

1.  **Security and Separation**:
    *   Keeps sensitive operations server-side
    *   Prevents exposing admin credentials to the client
2.  **Extended Functionality**:
    *   Custom registration flows with additional validations
    *   Business logic that needs to be coupled with user creation
    *   Integration with other systems during auth operations
3.  **Application Database Integration**:
    *   Maintaining app-specific user data alongside Keycloak IDs
    *   Storing extended profile information not suitable for Keycloak
    *   Managing application-specific permissions and data
4.  **API Protection**:
    *   Validating tokens for protected API endpoints
    *   Adding role-based access control to your APIs
    *   Processing token claims for authorization decisions
5.  **Audit and Compliance**:
    *   Logging authentication events server-side
    *   Enforcing security policies
    *   Controlling data access based on complex rules

In a typical architecture, the flow works like this:

1.  React app uses keycloak-js to authenticate users directly with Keycloak
2.  Upon successful authentication, the React app receives tokens
3.  React app sends these tokens with API requests to Spring Boot
4.  Spring Boot validates tokens and provides protected resources/APIs
5.  For administrative operations (like user registration), Spring Boot uses keycloak-admin-client to communicate with Keycloak

This separation of concerns creates a more secure and maintainable architecture than having your frontend directly handle all Keycloak operations.

====================
Breakdown of your architecture and the correct URLs:

1.  **Keycloak Server**:
    *   Running on port 8180 with context path /auth (environment variable KC_HTTP_RELATIVE_PATH=/auth)
    *   Full URL: `http://localhost:8180/auth` 
    *   This is your identity provider
2.  **Spring Boot Backend**:
    *   Running on port 8080 with context path /api (spring boot application.yml)
    *   Full URL: `http://localhost:8080/api`
    *   This is your application server that provides APIs and integrates with Keycloak
3.  **React Frontend**:
    *   Running on port 3000
    *   Full URL: `http://localhost:3000`
    *   This is your client application that users interact with

In your auth-service.js file, you need to use:

javascript

Copy

`const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8080/api';`

This is because your React app communicates with your Spring Boot backend for things like:

*   Getting Keycloak configuration via `/auth/config`
*   User registration via `/auth/register`
*   User profile operations via `/users/profile`

Even though authentication happens directly between React and Keycloak, all other API calls should go through your Spring Boot application, which serves as both:

1.  A proxy for some Keycloak operations (via admin client)
2.  A provider for your application-specific APIs

This architecture gives you the security benefits of Keycloak with the flexibility of your own backend for business logic and data persistence.

----------------------------

This guide will help you set up Keycloak as the identity and access management provider for your authentication system.

1\. Install and Run Keycloak
----------------------------

### Using Docker (Recommended)

Old  
`docker run -p 8180:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:23.0.6 start-dev`

New  
`docker run -p 8180:8080 -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.1.3 start-dev`

This will start Keycloak on port 8180 with an admin user with username `admin` and password `admin`.

### Manual Installation

    *   Client type: `OpenID Connect`
    *   Click "Next"
4.  Configure the client:
    *   Client authentication: `On`
    *   Authentication flow:
        *   Standard flow: `On` (for web applications)
        *   Direct access grants: `On` (for testing)
        *   Service accounts roles: `On` (for client credentials grant)
    *   Click "Next"
5.  Configure the URLs:
    *   Valid redirect URIs: `http://localhost:3000/*` (your React app URL)
    *   Web origins: `http://localhost:3000` (for CORS)
    *   Click "Save"
6.  Go to the "Credentials" tab and note down the client secret

4\. Configure Roles
-------------------

1.  Navigate to "Realm roles" in the left sidebar
2.  Click "Create role"
3.  Enter "user" as the role name and click "Save"
4.  Create another role named "admin"

5\. Configure User Registration
-------------------------------

1.  Navigate to "Realm settings" -> "Login" tab
2.  Enable "User registration"
3.  Enable "Verify email" if you want email verification
4.  Click "Save"

6\. Update Application Properties
---------------------------------

Update your `application.yml` file with the correct Keycloak settings:

keycloak.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/auth   
keycloak.realm=fintegerllp  
keycloak.resource=uaetaxlaws  
keycloak.credentials.secret=your-client-secret  

7\. Enable Social Login (Optional)
----------------------------------

To enable login with Google, Facebook, or other identity providers:

1.  Navigate to "Identity providers" in the left sidebar
2.  Click the provider you want to add (e.g., Google)
3.  Configure the provider with your client ID and secret
4.  Save the configuration

8\. Test Your Configuration
---------------------------

1.  Start your Spring Boot application
2.  Make a request to the `/auth/config` endpoint to verify that the Keycloak configuration is being returned correctly 
3.  Try registering a user using the `/auth/register` endpoint
4.  Check that the user has been created in Keycloak and in your database

Spring Boot app running on port: 8080  
Keycloak app running on port: 8180  
http://localhost:8080/api/auth/config   GET <-- To verify that the Keycloak configuration is being returned correctly
http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register POST <-- To register a user

Common Issues and Troubleshooting
---------------------------------

### CORS Errors

If you see CORS errors in your browser console:

1.  Make sure the Web origins in your Keycloak client is set to your frontend URL
2.  Check that your Spring Boot CORS configuration is correct
3.  Ensure that the allowed methods include all the HTTP methods your frontend uses

### Token Validation Errors

If token validation fails:

1.  Make sure your Spring Security configuration is correctly set up
2.  Verify that the issuer URI in the Spring Security configuration matches your Keycloak setup
3.  Check that the clock on your Spring Boot server is synced with the Keycloak server

### Authentication Flow Issues

If login or registration doesn't work:

1.  Check the Keycloak server logs for errors
2.  Verify that the client is configured correctly with the right authentication flows
3.  Ensure that redirect URIs in Keycloak match what your application is using

*   When scaling horizontally is a priority

Recommendation for Your Authentication System
---------------------------------------------

### Use PostgreSQL if:

1.  **Data Integrity is Critical**:
    *   You need to ensure user data is consistent and valid
    *   Strong relationships exist between users and other entities
    *   You're storing sensitive or financial information
2.  **Complex Queries are Common**:
    *   Your application performs complex reporting
    *   You need to join user data with multiple other tables
    *   Transaction support is important
3.  **Spring Data JPA Experience**:
    *   Your team has experience with JPA/Hibernate
    *   You prefer working with a structured ORM approach

### Use MongoDB if:

1.  **Flexible User Profiles are Required**:
    *   Users can have widely varying profile attributes
    *   You expect frequent changes to user data structure
    *   Rapid development iteration is important
2.  **Document-Centric Operations**:
    *   You primarily access complete user documents
    *   Single-document operations dominate your access patterns
    *   You store complex nested structures of user preferences
3.  **Scaling for Very Large User Bases**:
    *   You anticipate needing horizontal scaling
    *   You have a very large number of users
    *   Read performance at scale is a priority

Implementation Notes
--------------------

The authentication system provided uses PostgreSQL by default, which is a solid choice for most authentication systems due to:

1.  The structured nature of user and authentication data
2.  ACID compliance for critical user operations
3.  Strong data integrity for security purposes
4.  Natural relational mappings for user roles, profiles, and permissions

However, the system is designed to be database-agnostic, with the repository layer abstracted to allow for either MongoDB or PostgreSQL by uncommenting the relevant configuration in:

*   `pom.xml` for dependencies
*   `application.properties` for connection settings
*   Database-related classes with MongoDB

3.  Backend validates the request and creates user in Keycloak
4.  Keycloak creates the user identity
5.  Backend creates a corresponding user in PostgreSQL with Keycloak ID
6.  Success response is sent back to frontend
7.  User is automatically redirected to login or dashboard

### Login Flow

1.  User enters credentials in React login form
2.  React app uses Keycloak JS adapter to initiate login
3.  Keycloak authenticates the user and issues JWT tokens
4.  React app stores tokens and updates authentication state
5.  User is redirected to the dashboard

### Profile Management Flow

1.  Dashboard loads user profile data
2.  User updates profile information
3.  React app sends update request with JWT token
4.  Spring Boot backend validates the token
5.  Profile data is updated in PostgreSQL
6.  Updated profile data is returned to frontend

Database Schema
---------------
